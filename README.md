# Online library

Online library: Spring Boot 2.7/Spring Data/Spring Security/Jpa(Hibernate)/JSF/Postgresql

The online library is designed for searching and viewing books from database on various genres with search filter, pagination and sorting. This App supports two types of roles: Administrators and Users. Administrators have the ability to add, delete, and edit books, as well as add, delete, and edit authors, genres, and publishers. Users are only able to read books' content in PDF (if presented) and books' summary cards with views' count statistics. Books can be also rated on a 5-point scale. 

The services are tested using JUnit 5.

This app may be deployed on Tomcat 9.7.2.
